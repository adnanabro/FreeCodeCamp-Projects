    <li>On October 28, 2014, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige announced the full slate of films that the studio planned to release as part of Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU): <code>Captain America: Civil War (2016), Doctor Strange (2016), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Black Panther (2017), Captain Marvel (2018), and Inhumans (2018), as well as Avengers: Infinity War - Part 1 (2018) and Avengers: Infinity War - Part 2 (2019)</code>. </li>
    <li>Feige made this announcement at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, in an event that drew comparisons to Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference. Feige explained that the studio had wanted to announce all of the titles at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, but "things were not set" for the slate at that point, so the one-off event was used instead once all of the films could be confirmed. Marvel Studios had never done a solo event such as this before, and Feige had anticipated that it would occur in early August or mid-September before the October date was settled on.</li>
    <li>Following the Sony Pictures hack in 2014, it was revealed that Sony and Marvel were having conversations about potentially sharing Spider-Man. Marvel wanted to introduce a new version of <code>Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War</code> and then continue working with the Avengers in the future, while allowing Sony to keep creative control and use him in their own potential Spider-Man movies and spin-offs, with the potential of possibly using some of Marvel's characters.</li>
    <li>On February 9, 2015, Marvel made a post on their official website announcing a deal with Sony Pictures to allow Spider-Man to appear in the MCU. In June, Tom Holland was revealed to have been cast as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, and was set to appear in Civil War as well as the next Sony Spider-Man film, which would go on to be Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017).</li>
    <li>In July 2016, Avengers: Infinity War - Part 1 was retitled <code>Avengers: Infinity War</code>, while Part 2 was left untitled until the release of the first teaser trailer on December 7, 2018, when it was revealed to be <code>Avengers: Endgame</code>. After the title was revealed, Feige stated that withholding it for so long had backfired on the studio due to the high expectations that fans had set for the reveal. Despite this, Feige stood by the decision due to how the reveal of Infinity War and Endgame before <code>Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)</code> was released had taken away attention from that film.</li>
